_This documentation needs to be updated, this will happen in the latter part of this project :)_


in general for the prototype I tried to just keep everything in a single folder called "_test", but feel free to create your own folder in the structure
that make more sense for the continued development of the game.

Here are the most important blueprints for now:

Player Controller & current implementation of path tracing +  interaction trigger for world objects and enemies:

`All\Content\TopDown\Blueprints\BP_TopDownController`


Interaction with Enemy :

`All\Content\_test\enemyAI`


Interaction for Wall :

`All\Content\_test\lineTraceInterface`

Lantern and Enemy / Wall hit interactions :
`All\Content\chainLantern\lantern.uasset` and `All\Content\chainLantern\BP_chainlantern.uasset`
