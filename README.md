# Nekomancer: Paws of Light

![cover-image](https://github.com/Nocte-Clara/nekomancer/assets/nekomancer_banner.png)

Nekomancer: Paws of Light let's you play as a mystical cat wielding both the powers of necromancy and light. Armed with a magical lantern, you must navigate treacherous dungeons, solve puzzles, and outmaneuver lurking enemies using light-based mechanics. 

This repository contains the work done to develop the game in Unreal Engine as part of our ongoing project

Our plan is to make this a cooperative experience later on down the line with roguelike elements!

## The Game

Nekomancer: Paws of Light combines puzzle-solving (and later on cooperative mechanics) with a unique light-based gameplay system. Originally designed as a two-player co-op game, the initial implementation merges both characters into a single protagonist, allowing the player to wield both necromantic magic and a lantern to manipulate light and shadows.

## Story

In a world shrouded in darkness, you play as a lone and mystical necromancer, venturing into ancient ruins to uncover the secrets of lost magic. 

The ruins are haunted by shadowy creatures that thrive in darkness, making light both your greatest tool and your biggest liability. 

As you explore, you must master the balance between illuminating the path and avoiding unwanted attention, while you try and bring back some light into this world.

## Gameplay

### Core Mechanics:
- **Lantern Tossing** – Throw your lantern to light up distant areas, revealing paths and activating mechanisms. Be careful where you leave your lantern.
- **Shadow Walking** – Step into darkness to remain unseen, but beware—some shadows may contain hidden dangers.
- **Puzzle Solving** – Use light and darkness to trick your enemies, bridge gaps, and uncover secrets.
- **Enemy Encounters** – Foes are drawn to your light. Choose where to shine or hide.
