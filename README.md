# Documentation(ish)
in general for the prototype I tried to just keep everything in a single folder called "_test", but feel free to create your own folder in the structure
that make more sense for the continued development of the game.


Player Controller & current implementation of path tracing +  interaction with world objects:

All\Content\TopDown\Blueprints\BP_TopDownController


Interaction with Enemy :
All\Content\_test\enemyAI


Interaction for Wall (nothing there as of right now):
All\Content\_test\lineTraceInterface
